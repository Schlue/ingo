The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of the Ingo
Email Filter Rules Manager version H5 (3.2.0).

Ingo is an email-filter management application. It is fully internationalized,
integrated with Horde and the IMP Webmail client, and supports both server-side
(Sieve, Procmail, Maildrop) and client-side (IMAP) message filtering. For more
information on Ingo, visit http://www.horde.org/apps/ingo.

Barring any problems, this code will be released as Ingo H5 (3.2.0).  We
encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system.  Updated translations are very welcome, strings should not
change before the final release.
