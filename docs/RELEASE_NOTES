The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Ingo Email
Filter Rules Manager version H5 (3.1.1).

Ingo is an email-filter management application. It is fully internationalized,
integrated with Horde and the IMP Webmail client, and supports both server-side
(Sieve, Procmail, Maildrop) and client-side (IMAP) message filtering. For more
information on Ingo, visit http://www.horde.org/apps/ingo.

For upgrading instructions, please see

For detailed installation and configuration instructions, please see

The major changes compared to Ingo version H5 (3.1.0) are:
    * Restored compatibility with PHP 5.3.
    * Fixed filtering on user-defined headers.
