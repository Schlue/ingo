The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first beta release of the Ingo Email
Filter Rules Manager version H4 (2.0).

Ingo is an email-filter management application. It is fully internationalized,
integrated with Horde and the IMP Webmail client, and supports both server-side
(Sieve, procmail) and client-side (IMAP) message filtering.

IMPORTANT! This is a preview version that should not be used on production
systems. This version is considered feature complete but there are likely to be
bugs. You should not use this preview version with existing production
data. Migration of data from earlier versions has not been fully tested yet and
is not supported.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system. Updated translations are very welcome, though some strings
might still change before the release candidates are prepared.

To install Ingo, you need to install Horde first. See
https://github.com/horde/horde/blob/master/horde/docs/INSTALL for details. Once
Horde is installed, you can install Ingo with the following command:

  pear install horde/ingo-beta

Then log in to Horde with your adminstrator account to configure the
application and install the database schema from the configuration interface.

The major changes compared to the Ingo version H4 (2.0-ALPHA1) are:

    * Fixed creating new rules with PostgreSQL

Have fun!

The Horde Team.
