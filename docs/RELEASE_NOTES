The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first alpha release of the Ingo Email
Filter Rules Manager version H5 (3.2.0).

Ingo is an email-filter management application. It is fully internationalized,
integrated with Horde and the IMP Webmail client, and supports both server-side
(Sieve, Procmail, Maildrop) and client-side (IMAP) message filtering. For more
information on Ingo, visit http://www.horde.org/apps/ingo.

This is a preview version that should not be used on production systems.  This
version is considered feature complete but there might still be a few bugs.
You should not use this preview version over existing production data.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system.  Updated translations are very welcome, though some strings
might still change before the final release.

For upgrading instructions, please see
http://www.horde.org/apps/ingo/docs/UPGRADING

For detailed installation and configuration instructions, please see
http://www.horde.org/apps/ingo/docs/INSTALL

The major changes compared to Ingo H5 (3.1) versions are:
    * Sorting of rules via drag & drop.
    * Allow searching of rules by folder name.
    * Improved permission settings.
    * Added enotify and imap4flags Sieve extensions.
    * Added Oracle support.
    * Further improvements.
